# Python_Pygame_TestTubeGame


## Description
  This is a copy of a game that I saw on my phone and decided I wanted to make.
  It will feature the game and also perhaps an algorithym capable of solving the game on its own.
  
## Features
  * A test tube sorting game with up to ten colours
  * A variable number of test tubes depending on player choice
  * Difficulty settings
  * A hint system
  * Maybe an algorithym that can solve the game on it's own
  
  
#### Current Status: Unfinished
  * Logic mostly finished
